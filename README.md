# Auto-Submit-Code-in-Hackerrank
It will automate the process of submitting coding question on HackerRank. First, we will run a script on the HackerRankâ€™s website. It will then login using the credentials and will go to the specific module and start writing the code and then submit it. The script is written in NodeJS and uses Selenium which provides variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation.

Note: First install selenium-webdriver and chromedriver before running the .bat file.\n
How to install: \n
npm install chromedriver\n
npm install selenium-webdriver\n
